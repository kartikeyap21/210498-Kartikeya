assignment 1
Variables a,b,n are as given in question.
Variable s stores n(input) for computations and is divided by 10 at each stage to check divisiblity by a.
S stores the 10^(divisions performed).
first part is s.
second part is n-(s*S)
Divisibility by a of s checked .
Divisibillity by b of n-(s*S) checked.
When s%a=0 and (n-(s*S))%b=0 , n1=s and n2= n-(s*S)
